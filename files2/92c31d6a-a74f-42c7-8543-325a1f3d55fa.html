    <h2><strong>The Application Process</strong> </h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="112" id="112"></a>Is there an age requirement to live in Housing? </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. You must be at least 17 years of age at  the start of the license agreement and a high school   graduate or equivalent. You will need to fill out the <a href="documents/form/PDF_Consent_Form_Under_18.pdf">Consent Form for Residents under the age of 18.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="11" id="11"></a>Do I have to be admitted to CSULA   to apply for housing? </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. You will need to be admitted to CSULA and have paid your Enrollment  Confirmation Deposit (ECD) before you can apply for housing. You must also be  enrolled as a full-time student in order to pick up keys and move-in. To apply,  you will need to submit your online application and make your initial payment. <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/univ/housing/signup.php?#maincontent" target="_blank" title="Housing Forms"><strong>Apply here.</strong></a></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You  will be notified by email and provided information regarding your check-in day.  For the Fall Quarter, assignments are generally completed by mid or end of July  and confirmation emails are sent by the first two weeks of August.

    <h4><a name="13" id="13"></a>Can I use Financial Aid? How     much will Financial Aid cover? Will Financial Aid cover the initial     payment?    </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Yes,  many students pay with their Financial Aid. The amount Financial Aid will cover  depends on how much aid you are awarded. Tuition and fees are deducted first,  then the remainder is deducted for housing. Financial Aid will not cover your  security deposit and application fee. Please visit the <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/univ/finaid/" target="_blank"><strong>Financial Aid Office</strong></a> if you have specific  questions about Financial Aid. Always monitor your account to make sure your  aid is being disbursed and to track any remaining balances that you may be  required to pay out-of-pocket.</p>
      <p>To check on the status of your financial aid, log into your <a href="https://get.calstatela.edu/">GET</a> account. Once you have been award financial aid, please print a copy of your award and submit it to the Housing Services Office. We will review it and inform you as to how much of your aid will pay for your Housing and meal plan.</p>

    <h4><a name="14" id="14"></a>Will I get my deposit back?     What&rsquo;s the difference between a deposit and an initial payment?&nbsp;</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The  initial payment includes the security deposit and a non-refundable application  fee. The $100.00 security deposit is held in case of damages or other fees at  the end of your contract. If there are no fees pending for damages or other  reasons, your $100.00 deposit will be returned to you. </p>

<h4><a name="32" id="32"></a>How do I request a single?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Single  occupancy rooms may be requested by students with documented disabilities as  supported by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD).

  <p>Residents move in and  out of the Housing complex year-round and there may be times when you do not  have a roommate. Housing Services makes every effort to inform you in advance  when you have been assigned a roommate. Occasionally, however, there are  circumstances that make this notification difficult. If you are not paying for  a single space, you are required to keep half of your room clear and clean so  that a roommate can move in at any time. This also applies to an open space in  a triple occupancy bedroom. You and your housemates should also provide space  in the common areas (such as the bathroom, kitchen, and living room) for a new  housemate to move in if there is an empty space in your apartment. Preventing a  new housemate from moving in is considered a violation of policy listed in the <u>Housing  Services Violations</u> section of the <a href="http://web.calstatela.edu/univ/housing/License_Agreement.php">Housing Services Student Guide</a>, and may  result in additional charges and disciplinary action.</p>

<h4><a name="ChangeRooms" id="ChangeRooms"></a>How  do I request to transfer to another apartment? </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>During  Fall and Winter quarters, there will be a room change period during week three.  You will be asked to complete a Transfer Request Form. Requests will be  reviewed based on space availability. Room swaps may also be requested during  this time period. All room changes/swaps must be approved in advance and must  be completed within that week. Room changes or swaps that take place without  approval may result in charges and/or requirement to move back to your  originally assigned space. Check the weekly email for deadline dates and additional information.</p>
  <p>Requests  to change rooms due to roommate conflicts must first be addressed with your RA  or RD and depending on the circumstances they may approve room transfers.  You will need to schedule an appointment with your RD to share details for the  reason you are requesting a transfer. In  most cases the RD will provide assistance to resolve your current housing  status before considering a transfer. The Assignments Coordinator will confirm  assignments when space is available. Outside of the open transfer period each  request will be decided on a case by case basis.</p>

<h4><a name="MoveAgain" id="MoveAgain"></a>Once  I have moved in, will there be any occasions where I may need to move again? </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Housing  Services reserves the right to relocate individuals as needed. Relocation is  generally for administrative, emergency or disciplinary reasons. The Housing  Services Office keeps relocations to a minimum. An example of an administrative reason  is consolidating residents. This is when there are several open spaces in an  apartment and there is a need to use that apartment to accommodate for  gender/age differences. Consolidation may also occur during summer months, if  partially occupied apartments can be used for Summer Conference groups or  taken offline for upgrades. An emergency situation may involve damage to the  facility where minor or extensive repairs may be needed.&nbsp; </p>

<h4><a name="44" id="44"></a>Is there an overnight guest     policy? </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Overnight guests are permitted   to stay three (3) days and no more than nine (9) nights total per quarter, with   the permission of all roommates in the apartment. Guests must be registered   at the Community Information Center in  Phase I.   Failure by Licensee  to secure approval for overnight guests shall be grounds for disciplinary  action [Article 5, Section 42014 of Title five (5), California Code of  Regulations] including being charged the daily rate for each day that a  non-approved guest resides in Licensee&rsquo;s apartment. All overnight guests must  comply   with all Housing guidelines and regulations. Residents are responsible   for the conduct of their guests and any damages caused by their actions.

<h4><a name="48" id="48"></a>Am I responsible for damages to my  apartmen<strong>t</strong>?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>When  you move into your apartment, you and your housemates are responsible for inspecting  the apartment and completing the Apartment Condition Report (ACR). Damages at  check-in should be noted.&nbsp; If your  apartment or bedroom space requires any repairs, you should submit an online  <a href="https://housing.calstatela.edu/StarRezPortal/Default.aspx">work order</a>. As  a resident you have an important role in maintaining the condition of our  community. It is also part of your License Agreement to maintain your apartment  in good working order. You  will not be held responsible for normal wear and tear. However, any damages  caused by you or housemates, either intentionally, unintentionally or through  negligence in reporting observed repairs or maintenance issues will be  investigated and appropriate charges may be assessed.</p>
  <p>Throughout  the year, Housing Services staff will conduct regular apartment inspections to  assist in the assessment of potential damages. </p>
  <p>When  you check out, the original ACR will be used to review the condition of your  apartment and will be compared to the condition of your apartment when you  moved out. If there are any damages, including missing furniture or lack of  cleanliness, a charge will be assessed. The charges will be billed to the  responsible party if that information is available. In the event that we cannot  determine who is responsible, the entire apartment will be billed equally.&nbsp; </p>

<h4><a name="410" id="410"></a>Is smoking allowed in the     apartments? </h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>As outlined in the California State University Los Angeles Administrative     Procedures regarding the University Smoking Policy #006 which references     a concern for the health of all members of the University community,     smoking is not permitted in all enclosed indoor areas on-campus or in     any building on-campus, with the exception of specially posted smoking     areas approved by the Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety     Director. This includes all inside environments and exterior areas that     are encompassed by the building footprint. It also includes open balconies,     foyers, stairway landings, rooftops and pedestrian bridges between buildings     that begin and end at the building entrance/exit.</p>

<h4><a name="412" id="412"></a>How can I get things fixed in my apartment?</h4>

We do not mind if we  receive more than one work order from an apartment. It is better to make sure  to submit one than assume someone else will. We appreciate your assistance in  maintaining the condition of our apartments and community.</p>
