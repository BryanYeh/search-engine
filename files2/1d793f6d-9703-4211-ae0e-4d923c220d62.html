I am no longer able to reply individually to the large number of
messages from students who are interested in graduate study at
Berkeley.  PLEASE do not send me messages describing your
qualifications etc.  Please apply to the PhD program through the
<A HREF="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Prospective/">normal process</A>.
<P>
Admission decisions are made by the Admissions Committee.
Only the Admissions committee can evaluate your qualifications.
<P>
I will be happy to discuss research and/or
supervision with you once you have been admitted.
In the interests of fairness, I will not usually be able to
meet with prospective students who have not yet been admitted.
<P>
If you are interested in finding out what research goes on in my group,
please read our <A HREF="publications.html">publications</A>.
