						<p><strong>Piazza is a free platform</strong> for instructors to efficiently manage class Q&amp;A. Students can post questions and collaborate to edit responses to these questions. Instructors can also answer questions, endorse student answers, and edit or delete any posted content.</p>

<p></strong>Piazza is designed</strong> to simulate real class discussion. It aims to get high quality answers to difficult questions, fast!</p>

<p><strong>The name Piazza</strong> comes from the Italian word for plaza--a common city square where people can come together to share knowledge and ideas. We strive to recreate that communal atmosphere among students and instructors.</p>
