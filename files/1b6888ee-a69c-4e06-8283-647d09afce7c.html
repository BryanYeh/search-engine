          <p><strong>Spring</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Move-in date</strong><strong>: </strong>Friday, March 27, 2015, 10am-5pm at the Housing Services  Office.</p>
          <p>If you are unable to check-in (move-in) on your assigned  date or time, please contact the Housing Services Office for information on how  to request a later move-in date. <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong><u>MOVE-IN PROCESS</u></strong><br />
          Prior to students moving in, all students must have turned in their required  documentation</p>

            4. Complete the Apartment Condition Report form in detail and turn in the form  to a Housing Services Staff.<br />
            5. Now you are ready to move in all your belongings.          </p>

    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>HOUSING FEES</u></strong><br />
Housing Fees will be added to your GET account as rent, board (meal plan),  program fee, security deposit and application fee according to the payment plan  you selected when you completed your License Agreement online.

    </table>
    <p><strong><u>RESIDENTIAL PARKING LOT</u></strong> <br />
The parking lot for Housing residents is adjacent to the  housing complex (inside the fenced area, lot 7A). If you plan to use this lot,  a <strong>residential </strong>parking permit is required. Parking Enforcement will issue  citations to all vehicles that do not display the appropriate permit. </p>
    <p>Residential Parking Permits can be purchased from the <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/univ/police/pt_center.php" target="_blank"><strong>Parking  and Transportation Service Center</strong></a>. If you have purchased a University  Parking Permit at the time you registered for classes online, you will need to  take the University Parking Permit to the Parking and Transportation Service  Center where they will exchange your University Permit for a Residential  Parking Permit. </p>
    <p>Parking Lot 7A gets cleaned on Fridays from 7:30 am to  9:30 am. Please do not park in Lot 7A during this time. </p>
    <p><strong><u>LAUNDRY</u></strong><br />
      All washers and dryers accept debit or credit cards only. No debit card or  credit card? No problem; just make a trip to a shopping center and purchase a  prepaid credit or debit card. </p>
    <p>The washer and dryers are high efficiency machines, using  less water, detergent and energy to keep your clothing clean. Residents are  responsible for proper use of the machines and keeping track of their own <br />
      laundry. Access is 24/7 for all laundry rooms.<br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Phase I has a main  laundry facility located inside the Community Information Center (CIC) on the  East Side. <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Phase II has laundry  rooms located on the first floor of each of the five buildings. <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Golden Eagles  Apartments (GEA) has a laundry facility in the community center. </p>
    <p><strong><u>CLEANING</u></strong><br />
      Living together means cleaning together. Residents are responsible for keeping  their apartments clean throughout the year. Each apartment should establish an  agreement on how they keep their apartment cleaned. Residents should talk to  their housemates about the following: <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;What and how often the  apartment is cleaned (Having a schedule helps.) <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Who cleans what  (Everyone should be a part in cleaning!) <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;What cleaning supplies are bought or  used (some people may have issues with certain products). </p>
    <p>The Community Information Center (CIC) has vacuum  cleaners available to residents after 5 P.M. When checked out, the resident has  one hour to use the vacuum and return it to the CIC in order for other residents  use. To check out the vacuum, have your student identification card ready to  give to the RA on <br />
      duty.    </p>
    <p><strong><u>NEW RESIDENTS MOVING IN THROUGHOUT THE  YEAR</u></strong><br />
      New residents move in throughout the year. Please make sure that you do not  spread your belongings to the vacant space/room and the room/apartment is ready  for a new resident to move in at any time. As you can imagine, it can be a hard  transition and move in mid-year so we ask that you help make them feel welcome.<br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an empty  bed space in your room or an empty room in your apartment, please be sure to  keep the space (bed and furniture) clear of your belongings. <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;If your belongings  impede another student from moving in, you will be charged and subject to  disciplinary action. <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, Housing  Services staff may move resident belongings in order to clear the space for  newly assigned residents and may be charged for cleaning and labor.    </p>
    <p><strong><u>MAIL </u></strong><br />
      Residents will be assigned a mailbox for use and will be given the mailbox  combination upon check in. Mailboxes are shared among residents in the same  bedroom. To prevent theft of mail, residents should not share the combination  to their box with any other students or friends. </p>
    <p>There are two mail rooms located in housing for its  residents:<br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase I mail room  is located in the Community Information Center. <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase II mail room  is located along-side the Housing Office building. </p>
    <p>Mail Room hours are: <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Monday-Friday  9:00 am-5:30 pm <br />
  &middot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00 am-2:00 pm </p>
    <p>All correspondence for the Mail Room should be directed  to <a href="mailto:HousingMailroom@cslanet.calstatela.edu" target="_blank"><strong>HousingMailroom@cslanet.calstatela.edu</strong></a>. The Mail Room staff  is available to assist with repairs, teaching how to open boxes and any  questions or concerns regarding packages and deliveries. </p>
    <p><strong><u>PACKAGES </u></strong><br />
      Packages are received daily and available after 3:30 p.m. for pick up. In order  to pick up your package, you must present a picture ID and the white package  delivery notification slip, which is placed in your mailbox. For faster  processing of your packages always include your mailbox number and your name as  you are registered with Cal State L.A.&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mail/Packages MUST have your full name  as it appears on your ID.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Mail/Packages with a nickname or another  person&rsquo;s name will be returned to sender.    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><u>INTERNET </u></strong><br />
      Housing has a wireless (Wi-Fi) network. To access it, residents must use their  CSULA username and password as the log-in. There are two networks for residents  to access: Encrypted and Unencrypted. Both require a log-in. <br />
      For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
      username: jkrowling94<br />
      password: wizardsrule2004    </p>
    <p>For any issues regarding the internet residents may  contact <a href="http://www.calstatela.edu/its/" target="_blank"><strong>ITS</strong></a> on campus. They are located in Palmer Wing on the first  floor. </p>
    <p><strong><u>KEYS: LOST KEYS, COURTESY KEYS</u></strong><br />
      Residents are responsible for keeping track of the keys assigned to them at  move-in. </p>
    <p>The keys assigned to residents are:    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Core Key, this key  unlocks the front door of apartments. </li>
      <li>Bedroom Key, this key  unlocks residents&rsquo; bedroom door. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For any lost/misplaced keys, the resident is responsible  for reporting them immediately, as it is a safety and access concern. </p>
    <p>If you are unable to access your apartment/bedroom due to  lost/misplaced keys, courtesy keys are available at the Housing Services Office front  desk during  business hours. These keys must be returned within 20 minutes of being checked  out. </p>
    <p>After 5 PM, residents must call the RA on-duty to be  keyed into their apartment; they must produce identification to confirm they  are a resident of that apartment.</p>
    <p><strong><u>WORK ORDERS</u></strong><br />
      If something breaks or is not  working in your apartment, please fill out a Work Order online on the <a href="https://housing.calstatela.edu/StarRezPortal/Default.aspx?Params=L9ezxPcQnQtHT%2fDwvmM%2bxM%2b1pASxayVm">Housing Portal</a>.&nbsp; Once you log in, just click on the  Maintenance tab and fill out your Work Order.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><u>SECURITY</u></strong><br />
    The safety and security of our residents is of primary concern to the Housing  Services staff. Although our staffing, programming, and services assist in  creating a safe living environment, we need each resident&rsquo;s help to keep our  community safe.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep your door locked  at all times.</li>
