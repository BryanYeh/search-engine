													If you are interested in getting

													through an application and interview 
													process conducted by the scholarship 
													Committee of alumni volunteers.</p>
													<p>The Alumni Scholarship Committee 
													determines policies and procedures 
													for the scholarship selection 
													process, and directs the selection 
													process.</p>

													and consistently with alumni 
													by coordinating concise, compelling, 
													and interesting messaging; and 
													increasing the visibility of 
													the Alumni Association within 
													the local community. Members

													and volunteer political involvement.</p>
