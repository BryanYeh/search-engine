<h3> Welcome to CS 188! </h3>
<section class="description">
<h4>Announcements</h4>

<h4>Instructor</h4>
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/">Stuart Russell</a><BR>
740 Sutardja Dai Hall; 510 642 4964
<BR>
<h4>Lectures</h4>
Lectures will be in 2050 VLSB, TuTh 12.30-2.00pm.
<BR>
<h4>Catalog Description</h4>
<P>Ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. 
Topics include search, game playing, knowledge representation, inference, planning, 
reasoning under uncertainty, machine learning, robotics, perception, and language understanding.</P>
<BR>
<h4>What will actually happen</h4>
<p>You will learn to build intelligent agents - systems that perceive and act - for fully observable, partially observable and 
adversarial settings. Your agents will generate provably successful plans in deterministic environments, draw inferences in uncertain
environments, and optimize actions for arbitrary reward structures. They will learn from observation
and from rewards. The techniques you learn in this course apply to a wide 
variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the 
foundation for further study in any application area you choose to 
pursue.</p>
<p>See the <a href="course_schedule.html">syllabus</a> for slides, deadlines, and the lecture schedule.</p>
<p>See the <a href="course_information.html">course information page</a> for information about enrollment, prerequisites, assignments, grading, etc.
Note that programming projects will be done using instructional accounts (see <a href="submission_instructions.html">here</a> for account setup and submission instructions);
interactive homeworks will be done on <a href="edge.edx.edu">edge.edx.edu</a>; and discussion will take place on <a href="http://piazza.com/berkeley/fall2014/cs188">Piazza</a>.</p>
