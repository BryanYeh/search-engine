	    <h3><a name="eligfam" id="eligfam"></a>Eligible Family Members</h3>
	    <p>Eligible family members include spouses, domestic partners and dependent children under the age of 26.</p>
	    <p>In order to enroll a spouse for the first time, a marriage certificate and the spouse&rsquo;s social security number must be provided to the benefits office. </p>
	    <p>When enrolling a domestic partner, a Certificate of Domestic Partnership and a Statement of Financial Liability Form including the domestic partner&rsquo;s social security number must be provided to the benefits office. (Family Code Section 297 defines domestic partners as same sex or opposite sex if one or both of the persons are over the age of 62).</p>
	    <p>Eligible children are children under age 26 who have never been married (annulments are acceptable; not divorces), adopted children, stepchildren, children of a domestic partner and medically disabled children over the age of 26 who became disabled prior to the age of 26. Dependent children who are not the employee&rsquo;s natural children must live with the employee in a regular parent/child relationship and be economically dependent upon the employee.</p>
	    <p>Proof that family members meet the above criteria will be required before they are enrolled in an employee&rsquo;s insurance plans. Acceptable proof is:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li class="bullet">Legal Spouse - Marriage certificate (original or copy with state seal)<br />
          Domestic Partner - Registration of domestic partnership with the Secretary of State certification stamp</li>
          <li class="bullet">Natural Children - Birth certificate (original or copy with state seal)</li>
          <li class="bullet">Adopted Children - Adoption papers</li>
          <li class="bullet">Stepchildren - Birth certificate of child &amp; marriage certificate of parent and stepparent</li>
          <li class="bullet">Children of Domestic Partner - Birth certificate of child and Domestic Partner Certification from the Secretary of State</li>
          <li class="bullet">Dependent children that are not the employee&rsquo;s natural children - Completed Affidavit of Eligibility for Economically Dependent Children stating the employee is in a parent/child relationship and the child is economically dependent upon the employee for 50% of the child&rsquo;s financial support. Submit that form along with the child&rsquo;s birth certificate and proof of custody. The child must never have been married and must be under the age of 26 (except for certain disabled dependents).</li>
    </ul>
<p>A &quot;parent-child&quot; relationship is defined as one in which the employee has been given the authority and assumed responsibility for raising the child as his/her own child. There must be a parent-child relationship with the child who resides with the employee and the natural parent cannot be living in the same household as the child or can live in the household if they cannot fulfill parental responsibilities. If the child is disabled, special rules apply. </p>
	    <p>An employee may be asked periodically and without notice to provide supporting documentation, such as but not limited to, court records, birth certificate, proof of school registration, tax returns, statement of financial liability or any other documents, when requested by the University (or CalPERS) as long as the child is enrolled as his/her dependent.</p>
	    <p>It is imperative that employees notify the benefits office when dependents are no longer eligible for benefits coverage, i.e., employee divorce, marriage of child, child reaching age 26. Dependents who lose their eligibility will be able to continue coverage through COBRA. </p>

	    <h3><a name="healthben" id="healthben"></a>Health Care Benefits</h3>
	    <p>Medical, Dental, Flex-Cash, Vision, COBRA</p>
	    <p> Enrollment in the health and dental plans is <strong>not</strong> automatic.  New employees have <strong>60 days</strong> from the date of the eligible appointment to enroll in the insurance plans without evidence of insurability, regardless of any pre-existing condition(s).  The <strong>effective date</strong> for medical coverage and dental coverage is determined by the date the enrollment form is received by the Benefits Department.</p>
	    <p><strong>Example</strong>:  Benefit enrollment form submitted and received on June 10.  The effective date for medical coverage will be July 1 and the effective date for dental coverage will be August 1. </p>
	    <p>If your appointment date is on the last day of a month, which is the first day of the following pay period, the earliest effective date will be the first of the second month.</p>
	    <p><strong>Example</strong>:  Employee was hired and benefit enrollment form submitted and received on July 31.  The effective date for medical coverage will be August 1 and the effective date for dental coverage will be October 1. </p>
	    <p>These plans are voluntary; therefore, your signature is required on the benefits enrollment/change form and/or dental enrollment forms prior to the coverage taking effect. </p>
	    <p>Employees who fail to enroll within the 60-day timeframe will delay the effective date of medical coverage for a minimum of 90 days after submitting the appropriate document to the benefits office.  Reenrollment or changes in enrollment follow the same effective dates as enrollment. </p>
	    <p>Eligible employees who are granted a leave of absence without pay may continue participation in their medical plans by making direct payments of the full premiums to the plan providers.</p>

	    <h3 style="margin-top: 0"><a name="medical" id="medical"></a>Medical</h3>
	    <p>Medical Insurance coverage for eligible CSU employees is administered by the <a href="http://www.calpers.ca.gov/" target="_blank">Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS)</a>. A broad range of medical insurance plans are available to covered employees, with the majority of the premiums paid by the CSU. Open enrollment is typically in October with an effective date of the following January. Medical benefits are also available to eligible CSU retirees and dependents. To be eligible for retiree benefits at retirement, employees must be at least 50 years of age and have five years of retirement service credit. </p>
	    <p>The state contributes a substantial amount toward the employee&rsquo;s <span class="u"><strong>monthly</strong></span> premium, based on the number of family members enrolled in the plan.  All premiums are paid by monthly payroll deductions.  Please note that premiums, benefits and state contributions may change annually.</p>

        <h3><a name="flexcash" id="flexcash"></a>Flexcash</h3>
        <p>FlexCash is an optional benefit plan that allows employees to waive CSU medical and/or dental insurance coverage in exchange for additional cash in their paycheck each month.  If you decide not to keep the CSU medical and/or dental coverage, you will be required to certify on the FlexCash Enrollment Authorization form that you have alternative non-CSU medical and/or dental coverage and provide proof of other non-CSU coverage.</p>
        <p>You are eligible for the FlexCash plan if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="bullet">You meet the eligibility requirements for CSU medical and dental benefits</li>
          <li class="bullet">You are an active non-represented employee or an active represented employee in a bargaining unit which allows participation</li>
          <li class="bullet">You have other, non-CSU medical and/or dental coverage through an individual policy, private group coverage, or coverage related to employment outside the CSU system</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are <strong>not</strong> eligible to participate if you are covered as the dependent of another CSU employee.</p>
        <p>If you choose to receive cash in lieu of medical and/or dental coverage, the payment is as follows:</p>
        <table width="391" border="0">
          <tr>
            <td>Waive Medical only</td>
            <td>$128.00 per month</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Waive Dental only</td>
            <td>$12.00 per month</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Waive Medical and Dental</td>
            <td>$140.00 per month</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>These amounts may change subject to the collective bargaining agreement. </p>
        <p>FlexCash is treated as taxable income and is subject to the same payroll taxes as your regular salary.  This additional income will be reported as income on your W-2 form. </p>
        <p>You may not start or stop your FlexCash election in the middle of a plan year, except for allowable family status changes as defined by IRS regulations. These regulations specify that changes in FlexCash elections must be necessary or appropriate as a result of the family status changes. The enrollment changes must be requested within 60 days of the status change.</p>
        <p>If allowable family status changes occur, you can make the following changes by completing new enrollment forms within 60 days of the status change: </p>
        <p>If you chose cash, you can now choose medical and/or dental coverage. </p>
        <p>If you kept your other medical and/or dental coverage, you can now choose cash.</p>
        <p>Allowable family status changes include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="bullet">Marriage or divorce; </li>
          <li class="bullet">Death of a spouse or dependent (or loss of dependent status); </li>
          <li class="bullet">Birth or adoption of a child; </li>
          <li class="bullet">Termination or commencement of your spouse's employment; </li>
          <li class="bullet">Change from full-time to part-time employment (or vice versa by either you or your spouse, if that change affects your medical and/or dental coverage); </li>
          <li class="bullet">Start or return from an unpaid leave of absence by either you or your spouse; </li>
          <li class="bullet">Gain or loss of alternative non-CSU coverage; or </li>
          <li class="bullet"> A significant change in the alternative non-CSU coverage.</li>
