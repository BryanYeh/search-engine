<h4>Enrollment</h4>
<p>We aim to enroll as many students as possible subject to limits on room size, GSI availability,
and the department's <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Scheduling/CS/enrollment.html">
policies that govern admission into classes</a>.
The course staff does not control enrollment!</p>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>CS 61A and 61B:</b> Prior computer programming experience and a good understanding of clean, elegant implementations of nontrivial 
algorithms and data structures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>CS 70:</b> Facility with basic concepts of propositional logic and probability are expected, as well as the ability to understand
and construct proofs. CS 70 is the better choice for this course, but Math 55 could be substituted.
Some linear algebra and calculus will be used, but the necessary content will be covered in the course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Language</h4>
<p>Course programming assignments will be in Python. We do not assume 
that students have previous experience with the language, but we do 
expect you to learn the basics very rapidly. <a href="tutorial.html">Project 0</a> is designed to 
teach you the basics of Python, but if you want to get a head start here
 is a good tutorial: <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/sigunix/workshops/crashpython/crashpython.pdf">ACM Python Tutorial</a></p>
<h4>Assignments</h4>
<p>This class includes <b>five programming projects</b> in addition to the Python refresher and <b>regular electronic assignments</b> (some of which include tradition written components).</p>
<p><b>Collaboration:&nbsp;</b>Project 0 is to be completed alone. 
&nbsp;Projects 1 through 5 can be completed alone or in teams of two. 
&nbsp;When completing in a team of two it is important that both team 
members submit their team's project files into edX to ensure a grade is 
registered for both team members. &nbsp; Homework is to be submitted 
individually but may be discussed in groups.</p>
<p><strong>Project grading:</strong> Projects will by default be graded 
automatically for correctness, though we will review projects 
individually as necessary to ensure that they receive the credit they 
deserve. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Slip days:</b> Programming projects must be turned in electronically by 5:00pm on the listed due date. You will have <b>5 slip days</b> for these projects, up to <b>two of which can be used for each project</b>.
 Note that slip days are counted at the granularity of days, rounded up 
to the nearest day. The other homework assignments do not have late 
days; they cannot be submitted after the due date.</p>
<p><b>Ethics:</b> Submissions should acknowledge all collaborators and 
sources consulted. <b>All code and written responses should be original.</b> We
 trust you all to submit your own work, but to protect the integrity of 
the course from anyone who doesn’t want to play by the rules, we will 
actively be checking for code plagiarism (both from current classmates 
and previous semesters). Please read the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/acad.dis.shtml">EECS Department policy on academic dishonesty</a>.</p>
<h4>Grading</h4>
<p>Overall grades will be determined from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming Assignments (25%)</li>
<li>Electronic Assignments (15%)</li>
<li>Midterm exam (20%)</li>
<li>Final Exam (40%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grades are on the following fixed scale:</p>
<table style="padding-left: 20px">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>[90 – 100]%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A-</td>
<td>[85 – 90)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B+</td>
<td>[80 – 85)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>[75 – 80)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B-</td>
<td>[70 – 75)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C+</td>
<td>[65 – 70)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>[60 – 65)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C-</td>
<td>[55 – 60)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D+</td>
<td>[50 – 55)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>[45 – 50)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D-</td>
<td>[40 – 45)%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>[0 – 40)%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These cutoffs represent grade minimums. We may adjust grades upward 
based on class participation, extra credit, etc. The grade of A+ will be
 awarded at the professor’s discretion based on exceptional performance.</p>
<p><b>Regrade Policy:</b> If you believe an error has been made in the 
grading of one of your exams or assignments, you may resubmit it for a 
regrade. For any regrade requests, send an email to the staff list with a
 detailed explanation of which problems you think we marked incorrectly 
and why. Regrades for cases where we mis-applied a rubric in an 
individual case are much more likely to be successful than regrades that
 argue about relative point values within the rubric, as the rubric is 
applied to the entire class. Because we will examine your entire 
submission in detail, your grade can go up or down as a result of a 
regrade request.</p>
